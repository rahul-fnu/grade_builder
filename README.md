This is a repo for high school exam preperation site built using NextJS, React, MongoDB and JavaScript and have used AWS Cognito to authenticate users. The idea behind it was to give students appearing [CAIE A Level Examination](https://www.cambridgeinternational.org/programmes-and-qualifications/cambridge-advanced/cambridge-international-as-and-a-levels/) an all in one platform to view and solve examination questions which students in previous exam sessios were assesed upon and track their learning process. Currently the only major way students can achieve this is by downloading PDF files from the [internet](https://papers.xtremepape.rs/CAIE/AS%20and%20A%20Level/) and printing them out. This webapp is equipped with a rich text editor to allow students to write scientific notations and has a dashboard to track progress. As soon a as user sumits their answer, the score is updated on our database and dashboard is updated with the number of questions user has completed. This website is still in internal testing phase so we have only added a few physics questions on our databases. We will soon give it to small number of end users to test it out before we add more questions and features which we plan to roll out before the examination session of March 2022. We have attached screenshots of the basic functioning of the site and will soon add a link to Demo site.
